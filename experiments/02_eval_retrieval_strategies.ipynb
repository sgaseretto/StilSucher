    "## Evaluating Precision@k for Qdrant Retrieval Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to systematically evaluate the Precision@k for various retrieval methods offered by Qdrant. We will explore the following retrieval methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search**: Finds the k nearest neighbors to a given target vector.\n",
    "- **Recommend**: Identifies the k nearest neighbors to the positive vectors while distancing from the negative vectors, with two strategies:\n",
    "    - AVERAGE_VECTOR\n",
    "    - BEST_SCORE\n",
    "- **Discovery**: Combines target vectors with (positive, negative) pairs for refined retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by loading our dataset, preparing it for insertion into Qdrant, and subsequently evaluating each method's performance in terms of Precision@k. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks we have created data points with their corresponding embeddings, that we will use to test the different retrieval techniques. We will run the Qdrant container that we have specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.\n"

    "### Evaluating Retrieval Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "With our data now inserted into Qdrant, we can proceed to evaluate the Precision@k for each retrieval method. This evaluation will provide insights into the effectiveness of each method in retrieving relevant items from our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to explore various ways of performing Text2Image retrieval. Beyond the traditional search method where we specify a query and receive results, we also want to specify attributes we want to be considered in our search and attributes we want to avoid. This can be achieved using the `recommend` and `discover` APIs provided by Qdrant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to simulate five situations:\n",
    "1. **Simple Text2Image search**: Users provide a description for an item they are looking for. For this, we use the `detail_desc` column in `articles.csv`.\n",
    "2. **Text2Image search with enhanced description**: Users not only provide a description of what they are looking for, but also specify an attribute from the item they are looking for and something they want to avoid. To do this, we append the following to the end of the `detail_desc`: `It has to be {category value for that item}, not {another random value from the same category}`.\n",
    "3. **Recommendations API**: For this strategy, we use the `detail_desc` and a `positive_sample` for the positive vectors and `negative_sample` for the negative vectors. We will test two strategies:\n",
    "    - `AVERAGE_VECTOR`: We average the positive vectors and use the resulting vector as the query.\n",
    "    - `BEST_SCORE`: We use the positive vectors individually as queries and select the one with the highest score.\n",
    "4. **Discovery API**: This is similar to the `Recommendations API`, but the target will be `detail_desc` and the `positive` and `negative` pairs will be from the `positive_sample` and `negative_sample`."

    "## Conclusion and Comparison of Retrieval Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon evaluating the Precision@k for each method, we can draw comparisons to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each retrieval method in the context of our specific dataset and use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision@16 for Search (target): ~69%$\n",
    "- Precision@16 for Search (enhanced description): ~72%\n",
    "- Precision@16 for Recommend (Average Vector): ~67%\n",
    "- Precision@16 for Recommend (Best Score): ~66.7%\n",
    "- Precision@16 for Discovery: ~64.3%\n",
    "\n",
    "From the results, we observe that enhancing the description of the item we are looking for, and specifying attributes we want to be considered and avoided, improves the Precision@k for the Search method. Following the enhanced Search, the Recommendations API with the `AVERAGE_VECTOR` strategy performs next best. The `BEST_SCORE` strategy performs slightly worse, and the Discovery API yields the least effective results among the four methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also important to note a few things:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Our method of obtaining positive and negative samples is somewhat naive and may not always provide useful context. A potential future experiment could involve using a Generative Language Model that receives the item information and generates more semantically meaningful positive and negative samples. This could potentially yield better embeddings for the Discovery API.\n",
    "- We are doing only retrieval over an approximate nearest neighbors index, so the way we build the index might also affect the results. We could experiment with different index types and parameters to see if we can improve the results.\n",
    "- We are only retrieving candidates, but experimenting with a way to rank the candidates could also be interesting. We could train a second model that concats the text and image embeddings and predicts a score, and then use this score to rank the candidates. Tools like `Quaterion` could be useful for this."
